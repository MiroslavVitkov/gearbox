\section{Requirements}
\SetVar{P_output_kW}{11}          \\
\SetVar{P_output_max_rpm}{5000}

%P_output_kW = \FPprint{P_output_kW} kW
%n_output_max_rpm = \FPprint{n_output_max_rpm} rpm

\section{Motor selection}
From [4] we select the Siemens 1PH209 spindle motor.
It is the recommended built-in motor for standard machine tool spindle.
Outside diameter is 205mm, output shaft diameter 67mm.
Nominal speed 1500rpm, maximum 10000rpm.

\section{Kinematic diagram} % (plan for rotational velocities)
The goal of the gearbox is to provide sufficient torque to the spindle at low motor speeds (below $n_{nominal}$).
For selecting the low gear we utilize the rule of thumb to choose a transfer ratio between $1/3$ and $1/4$:
$$ TR_{low} = 1/4 $$
For selecting the high gear, we try to match the maximum speed of the motor with the required maximum spindle speed by specification:
$$ TR_{high} = n_{spindle, max} / n_{motor, max} $$

Let us suppose the goal of our gearbox is to operate the motor in its most efficient region.
Furthermore, let us select a low-speed gear of 1500rpm in addition to the required by specification 5000rpm gear.
Sonsequenctly, we need transfer ratios of 1.000 and 3.333.
%TODO: draw respective diagram

\section{Components sizing}
\subsection{Gears}
Requirements: Design input shaft gears G11 and G12 and output shaft gears G21 and G22
Both center distances (G11-G21 and G12-G22) must be equal.
All gears must be capable of transmitting the rated torque \PrintVar{P_output_kW} plus efficiency losses.
Gear teeth must be shaped with a cutoff or round-off to assist gear engagement.
Conventional spur gears with involute teeth profile have been selected for this application.
\subsubsection{Contact ratio}
From [5] we know that Contact ratio is defined as
$\epsilon_a = 1.88 - 3.2 (1/z_1 + 1/z_2)$ % TODO: epproximately equal
and "for smooth and quiet operation, the contact ratio should not be less than 1.2".
\subsubsection{Standard Basic Rack Tooth Profile}
Due to the numerous advantages of using standard tooth geometry, we decide to adhare to the Standard Basi Rack Tooth Profile.
$$\alpha = 20$$  % pressure angle  TODO: degrees
$$h_a = 1.00m$$ % addendum
$$c = 0.25m$$ % bottom clearance
$$h_f = 1.25m$$ % daedendum
$$\rho = 0.38m$$ % fillet radius
$$h_w = 2.00m$$ % active tooth depth
$$h = 2.25m$$ % whole depth
$$s = (\pi m)/ 2$$ % tooth thickness

\subsection{Shafts}
Requirements: desing Input shaft and Output shaft with appropriate key / spline / press  joints, capable of transmitting 11kW plus efficiency losses.
As the requirements match, we will callculate only a single shaft design.
